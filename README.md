# Brick Breaker

This is a very simple Brick Breaker game.

Shape classes in the `SwingShapes` package came from here: [https://github.com/SER120L/SwingShapes](https://github.com/SER120L/SwingShapes).

Press the A key to move the paddle left and the D key to move the paddle right.
The goal is to keep the ball in the air and have it hit all of the bricks on screen.
If the ball hits the bottom of the screen, it is game over.

The `main` method for this program is found in the `Main.java` file.

The `GamePanel.java` file is the "engine" code, while the `GameLoop.java` file has all the actual game logic.
